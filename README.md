# Markdown CMS

[![CI](https://github.com/pavel-genai/markdown-cms/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pavel-genai/markdown-cms/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A flat-file content management system built with TypeScript and Node.js. Content is stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter and served as rendered HTML through an Express API.

## Features

- Markdown rendering with [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)
- YAML frontmatter (title, date, tags, slug)
- Full-text search with inverted index
- Tag-based filtering
- File watcher for live preview
- Clean HTML output with minimal styling

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The server starts at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /posts` | List all posts |
| `GET /posts/:slug` | View a single post |
| `GET /search?q=query` | Full-text search |
| `GET /tags/:tag` | Filter posts by tag |

## Content

Add Markdown files to the `content/` directory with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: My Post
date: "2026-01-01"
tags:
  - example
slug: my-post
---

Your content here.
```

The file watcher will automatically pick up changes.
